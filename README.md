# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
This contains work for the Getting and Cleaning Data Project

run_analysis.R reads in all the test and train data as well as the feature names, the descriptive activity names and the subject data. The test and train data are merged to create one data set.
The the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are extracted. 
The descriptive activity names are usedd to name the activities in the data set and the data set is labeled with descriptive variable names. 

An independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject is then created and output.
